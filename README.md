In Uzbekistan, where many ethnic groups live together, the teaching tools for code teaching are only made in the Russian language. Therefore, you need to know the Russian language, not the Uzbek language, so you can learn coding. Uzbek people who do not know Russian can not learn coding. So we have created a coding education site in Uzbek language for children. Uzbek children will be able to learn coding not only through written coding, but also through various play tools.
